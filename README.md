# 🌐 Jeanluc's Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website designed and developed by **Musengayezu Jean Luc** to showcase skills, projects, and professional background in web development and IT.  
The website is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with responsive design principles to ensure it looks great on all screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Page structure and semantic content  
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsive layout design  
- **Font Awesome** – Icons for visual enhancement  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – For interactivity and menu toggling  
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and hosting

## 💡 How It Works

The website uses a **media query (`@media only screen and (max-width: 768px)`)** to adapt layout and styling for smaller screens.  
A JavaScript function toggles between a **menu icon** (`☰`) and a **close icon** (`✖`) to display or hide navigation links in mobile view.

Would you like me to make this README **GitHub-optimized** (with badges, icons, and deploy instructions for GitHub Pages automatically formatted)?  
It’ll make your repo look more professional and attractive to recruiters.
